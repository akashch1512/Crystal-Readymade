# E-Commerce Product Comparison Web 

## Description

This project is an **e-commerce product comparison website** built with **React** and **Node.js**. The website allows users to compare products across multiple online marketplaces such as **Flipkart**, **Amazon**, and **Myntra**. Due to API access restrictions from these platforms, mock data is currently used to simulate the product comparison. In the future, if API keys are obtained, the product data will be dynamically fetched, making the comparison even more accurate and up-to-date.
