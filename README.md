# E-Commerce Product Comparison Web 

## Description

This project is an **e-commerce product comparison website** built with **React** and **Node.js**. The website allows users to compare products across multiple online marketplaces such as **Flipkart**, **Amazon**, and **Myntra**. Due to API access restrictions from these platforms, mock data is currently used to simulate the product comparison. In the future, if API keys are obtained, the product data will be dynamically fetched, making the comparison even more accurate and up-to-date.


## Features

- **User Authentication**: Login and registration functionality.
- **Responsive Design**: The website is designed to be fully responsive for optimal viewing on both mobile and desktop devices.
- **Product Comparison**: Users can compare products across categories such as electronics, clothing, etc., displayed in a grid layout.
- **Developer Profiles**: View profiles of developers with an interactive UI section.
- **Dark Theme**: A dark theme UI with smooth user transitions and RGB effects for a modern user experience.
- **Interactive Interface**: Real-time comparison updates with user-friendly navigation.
